<h2>A PLAY OF FEATURES.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="note">[Being Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER'S production of <i>The
Attack</i> at the St. James's.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="center">SCENE&mdash;Alexandre M&eacute;rital's
<i>house</i>.</p>
<p class="center">ACT I.</p>
<p><i>Daniel M&eacute;rital</i>. My father is a wonderful man.
Leader of the Social Party in the Chamber of Deputies, noted among
his colleagues for his absolute integrity, supported by the
millionaire newspaper proprietor, Fr&eacute;peau, whose motives,
between ourselves, are not altogether above&mdash; Oh, are you
there, Father? I didn't see you. I'm just off to play tennis.</p>
<p class="exit">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Ren&eacute;e de Rould.</p>
<p><i>Ren&eacute;e</i>. Mr. M&eacute;rital, may I speak to you a
moment?</p>
<p><i>Georges Alexandre M&eacute;rital (with, characteristic
suavity</i>). Certainly.</p>
<p><i>Ren&eacute;e</i>, I love you. Will you marry me?</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital (surprised</i>). Well, really&mdash;this
is&mdash;I&mdash;you&mdash;we&mdash;er, he, she,
they&mdash;Frankly, you embarrass me. (<i>Apologetically</i>) This
is my embarrassed face.</p>
<p><i>Ren&eacute;e</i>. But I thought you loved me. Don't you?</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital</i>. No. That is to say, yes. Or
rather&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Ren&eacute;e (tearfully</i>). I w-wish you could make it
plainer whether you d-do love me and are pretending you don't, or
you d-don't love me and are pretending you do. It's v-very
unsettling for a young girl not to know.</p>
<p><i>Sir GEORGES ALEXANDRE (surprised and a little hurt</i>).
Can't you tell from my face?</p>
<p><i>Miss MARTHA HEDMAN</i>. This is my first appearance in
England, Sir GEORGES.</p>
<p><i>Sir GEORGES</i>. True. I was forgetting. Well, when you have
been with us a little longer, you will know that this is my face
when I adore anyone very much, but, owing to an unfortunate episode
in my past life, am forced to hide my love.</p>
<p><i>Ren&eacute;e (alarmed</i>). Your past <i>wife</i> isn't alive
somewhere?</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital</i>. Oh no, not that sort of thing at all.
(<i>Embracing her carefully</i>.) I will marry you, Ren&eacute;e,
but run along now because my friend Fr&eacute;peau is coming, and
he probably wants to talk business.</p>
<p class="exit">[<i>Exit</i> Ren&eacute;e.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Fr&eacute;peau.</p>
<p><i>Fr&eacute;peau (excitedly</i>). M&eacute;rital, you are in
danger. A scandalous libel is being circulated about you.</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital (calmly</i>). Pooh! Faugh!</p>
<p><i>Fr&eacute;peau</i>. It is said that thirty years ago
(Alexandre's <i>nose twitches</i>), when you were in a solicitor's
office (Alexandre's <i>jaw drops</i>), you stole ninepence from the
stamp drawer (Alexandre's <i>eyeballs roll</i>). Of course it is a
lie?</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital (with a great effort obtaining command of his
features again</i>). Of course.</p>
<p class="center">CURTAIN.</p>
<p class="center">ACT II.</p>
<p><i>Daniel M&eacute;rital</i>. Father's face has been very odd
these last few weeks. Sometimes I wonder whether he didn't steal
the money after all. But we shall know after the libel action this
afternoon. It starts at two. Oh, are you there, Father? I'm just
going to see a man about something.</p>
<p class="exit">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Fr&eacute;peau.</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital</i>. Ah, Fr&eacute;peau, the man I wanted to
see. (<i>Plaintively</i>) Fr&eacute;peau, when you called on me in
the First Act, don't you think you might have given some indication
by the play of your features that it was <i>you</i> who originated
this libel against me, and that you are my deadly enemy? The merest
twitch of the ears would have been enough.</p>
<p><i>HOLMAN CLARK</i>. I wanted it to be a surprise for the
audience.</p>
<p><i>Sir GEORGES</i>. Yes, but is that art?</p>
<p><i>HOLMAN CLARK</i>. Besides, in real life&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Sir GEORGES (amazed</i>). Real life? Good Heavens, HOLMAN, is
this <i>your</i> first appearance in England too?</p>
<p><i>HOLMAN CLARK (annoyed</i>). Let's get on with the play.</p>
<p><i>Sir GEORGES</i>. Certainly. Wait a moment till I've got my
"strong-man-with-his-back-to-the-wall" expression. (<i>Arranging
his face</i>.) How's that?</p>
<p><i>HOLMAN CLARK</i>. Begin again.... That's better.</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital (sternly</i>). Now then, Fr&eacute;peau! I
must ask you to give instructions that the libel is withdrawn in
court this afternoon. If not&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Fr&eacute;peau</i>. Well?</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital (softly</i>). I know somebody else who stole
something from the stamp drawer thirty years ago. (Fr&eacute;peau's
<i>whiskers tremble</i>.) Aha, I thought I'd move you this
time.</p>
<p><i>Fr&eacute;peau</i>. It's a lie! How did you find out?</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital (blandly</i>). I said to myself, "I am the
hero of this play and I've got to get out of this mess somehow. If
I could only find some papers incriminating the
villain&mdash;that's you all would be well." So
I&mdash;er&mdash;found them.... It's no good, Fr&eacute;peau.
Unless you let me off, you're done.</p>
<p><i>Fr&eacute;peau (getting up</i>). Well, I suppose I must. But
personally I'd be ashamed to escape through such a rotten
coincidence as that. (<i>Making for the door</i>.) I'll just go and
arrange it. Er, I suppose this is the end?</p>
<p><i>Sir GEORGES</i>. The end? Good Heavens, man, I've got my big
scene to come. I have to explain <i>why</i> M&eacute;rital stole
the money thirty years ago!</p>
<p><i>HOLMAN CLARK (eagerly</i>). Let me guess. His wife was
starv&mdash;</p>
<p><i>SIR GEORGES</i>. No, no, don't spoil it. (<i>Sternly</i>)
It's a very serious thing, HOLMAN, to spoil an actor-manager's big
scene.</p>
<p class="center">CURTAIN.</p>
<p class="center">ACT III.</p>
<p><i>Daniel M&eacute;rital</i>. Father has won his case. I
<i>am</i> glad. Oh, are you there, Father? I'm just going
downstairs to count the telegrams.</p>
<p class="exit">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Ren&eacute;e.</p>
<p><i>Ren&eacute;e</i>. You have won the case? I knew it. I knew
you were innocent.</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital (nobly</i>). Renee, I am not innocent. I did
steal that ninepence. I would have confessed it before, but I had
to think of my family. (<i>Cheers from the gallery</i>.) Of course
it would also have been unpleasant for <i>me</i> if it had been
known, but that did not influence me. (<i>More cheers</i>.) I
thought only of my children. Let me tell you now <i>why</i> I stole
it.</p>
<p><i>Ren&eacute;e (eagerly</i>). Let me guess. Your wife was
starving&mdash;</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital (astounded</i>). Wonderful! How ever did you
know?</p>
<p><i>Ren&eacute;e</i>. &mdash;and you meant to repay the
money.</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital</i>. More and more marvellous. Yes,
Ren&eacute;e, that was how it was. But it hardly does justice to
the affair. It is too short. I want to tell you the story of my
<i>whole</i> life and then you will understand. Watch my face
carefully and observe how it works; notice the constant movement of
my hands; listen to the inflections of my voice. This is going to
be the longest speech ever made by an actor-manager, and you
mustn't miss a moment of it. H'r'm! Now then. (<i>Nobly</i>) I was
born fifty-three years ago. My father....</p>
<p><i>Ren&eacute;e (half-an-hour later</i>). I still love you.</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital (with some truth</i>). What a love yours
is!</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Daniel, Julien <i>and</i> Georgette
M&eacute;rital.</p>
<p><i>Daniel</i>. Father, we have a confession to make. For some
time we doubted your innocence. Your face&mdash;well, you'd have
doubted it yourself if you'd seen it.</p>
<p><i>M&eacute;rital (taking his hand affectionately</i>). Ah!
Daniel, I see I must tell you the story of my life. (<i>Excitement
among the audience</i>.) And you too, Julien. (<i>Panic</i>.) Yes,
and&mdash;little Georgette!</p>

<h2>THE ROMANCE OF A BATTLESHIP.</h2>
<p class="center"><i>(From the Navy League Annual of 1916.)</i></p>
<p>I have just returned (writes a Naval correspondent) from an
interesting visit to the condemned battleship, <i>H.M.S.
Indefensible</i>, which is now anchored off Brightlingsea, in the
charge of retired petty-officer Herbert Tompkins and his wife.</p>
<p>The history of <i>H.M.S. Indefensible</i>, as gathered from the
lips of her present curator, is so romantic as to be worthy of
permanent record. In reply to my first question, "Whom did she
belong to first of all?" Mr. Tompkins said, "Well, she was ordered
first of all by the Argentine Republic, but, owing to a change of
Government, they sold her to the Italians. I remember the launch at
Barrow quite well," he said. "It was a mighty fine show, with the
Italian Ambassador and his wife&mdash;the <i>Magnifico Pomposo</i>,
they called her, I think it was&mdash;and there was speechifying
and hurraying and enough champagne drunk to float her. That was
just three years ago: a super-Dreadnought, they called her."</p>
<p>"Then how did the British Government get her?"</p>
<p>"Lor bless you, Sir, that didn't come for a long time yet. Ye
see, Italy shortly afterwards made an alliance with Denmark, and,
wishing to do the Danes a good turn, she arranged to sell them the
<i>Magnifico Pomposo</i> at cost price&mdash;about three millions I
think it was. But immediately afterwards the Russo-Chinese war
broke out, and the Chinese offered the Danes four millions for the
<i>Dannebrog</i>, as they had called her, so by the time the
engines were put into her she had been rechristened the
<i>Hoang-Ho</i>. But the war never came off: you remember that Mr.
ROOSEVELT settled it by fighting a single combat with the Russian
champion after he had been appointed President of China; so the
Chinese leased the <i>Hoang-Ho</i> to the King of SIAM for four
years at a million a year."</p>
<p>"Did she get out to Siam, then?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, Sir, no fear. The crew ran her on the Goodwin Sands on
her trial trip, and there she stuck for a year. Before they got her
off the Siamese had been released from their bargain by the Hague
Tribunal, Mr. ROOSEVELT had resigned the Presidency of China for
that of Mexico, and the new President sold the <i>Chulalongkorn</i>
back to Great Britain. Of course by that time she was quite
obsolete, so they called her the <i>Indefensible</i>, and put a
nucleus crew on board for a few months. Then when Mr. LLOYD GEORGE
became Prime Minister, they offered her to Canada as a gift; but
the Canadians didn't like her name. And when Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL
came back last month he decided that she was to be made a target;
but last week I heard she was to be sold for scrap-iron."</p>
<p>"Then whom does she belong to now?"</p>
<p>"Well, Sir, some says she belongs to Canada, and others say
she's British, and others say she belongs to Mr. CHURCHILL, but in
a manner of speaking I think she rightly belongs to Mrs. Tompkins
and me."</p>

<h2>A NEW BOOK OF BEAUTY.</h2>
<p>A hundred years ago they had line, engravings by CHARLES HEATH,
and the long-necked, ringleted ladies looked wistfully or
simperingly at you. I have several examples: <i>Caskets, Albums,
Keepsakes</i>.</p>
<p>This book is different. The steel engravers have long since all
died of starvation; and here are photographs only, but there are
many more of them, and (strange innovation!) there are more
gentlemen than ladies. For this preponderance there is a good
commercial reason, as any student of the work will quickly
discover, for we are now entering a sphere of life where the beauty
of the sterner sex (if so severe a word can be applied to such
sublimation of everything that is soft and voluptuous and
endearing) is more considered than that of the other. Beautiful
ladies are here in some profusion, but the first place is for
beautiful and guinea-earning gentlemen.</p>
<p>In the old Books of Beauty one could make a choice. There was
always one lady supremely longer-necked, more wistful or more
simpering than the others. But in this new Book of Beauty one turns
the pages only to be more perplexed. The embarrassment of riches is
too embarrassing. I have been through the work a score of times and
am still wondering on whom my affections and admiration are most
firmly fixed.</p>
<p>This new Book of Beauty has a very different title from the old
ones. It is called <i>The Pekingese</i>, and is the revised edition
for 1914.</p>
<p>How to play the part of <i>Paris</i> where all the competitors
have some irresistibility, as all have of either sex! Once I
thought that Wee Mo of Westwood was my heart's chiefest delight, "a
flame-red little dog with black mask and ear-fringes, profuse coat
and featherings, flat wide skull, short flat face, short bowed legs
and well-shaped body." But then I turned back to Broadoak Beetle
and on to Broadoak Cirawanzi, and Young Beetle, and Nanking Fo, and
Ta Fo of Greystones, and Petsh&eacute; Ah Wei, and Hay Ch'ah of
Toddington, and that superb Sultanic creature, King Rudolph of
Ruritania, and Champion Howbury Ming, and Su Eh of Newnham, and
King Beetle of Minden, and Champion Hu Hi, and Mo Sho, and that
rich red dog, Buddha of Burford. And having chosen these I might
just as well scratch out their names and write in others, for every
male face in this book is a poem.</p>
<p>The ladies, as I have said, are in the minority, for obvious
reasons, for these little disdainful distinguished gentlemen figure
here as potential fathers, with their fees somewhat indelicately
named; for there's a husbandry on earth as well as in heaven.</p>
<p>Such ladies as are here are here for their beauty alone and are
beyond or below price. Their favours are not to be bought. Among
them I note with especial joy Yiptse of Chinatown, Mandarin Marvel,
who "inherits the beautiful front of her sire, Broadoak Beetle";
Lavender of Burton-on-Dee, "fawn with black mask"; Chi-Fa of
Alderbourne, "a most charming and devoted little companion"; Yeng
Loo of Ipsley; Detlong Mo-li of Alderburne, one of the "beautiful
red daughters of Wong-ti of Alderburne," Champion Chaou Ching-ur,
of whom her owner says that "in quaintness and individuality and in
loving disposition she is unequalled" and is also "quite a 'woman
of the world,' very <i>blas&eacute;e</i> and also very punctilious
in trifles;" Pearl of Cotehele, "bright red with beautiful back";
E-Wo Tu T'su; Berylune Tzu Hsi Chu; Ko-ki of Radbourne and
Siddington Fi-fi.</p>
<p>Every now and then there is an article in the papers asking and
answering the question, What is the greatest benefit that has come
to mankind in the past half century? The answer is usually the
Marconi system, or the cinema, or the pianola, or the turbine, or
the R&ouml;ntgen rays, or the telephone or the motor car. Always
something utilitarian or scientific. But why should we not say that
it was the introduction of Pekingese into England from China?
According to an historical sketch at the beginning of this book,
the first Pekingese were brought over in 1860, after the occupation
of Pekin by the Allies. The first black ones came here in 1896, and
now in 1914 there are thousands of these wholly alluring and
adorable and masterful little big-hearted creatures in England,
turning staid men and women into ecstatic worshippers and making
children lyrical with cries of appreciation. The book before me is
the finest monument yet raised to this conquering breed.</p>

<h2>MISUNDERSTOOD.</h2>
<p class="center"><i>(A Story of the Stone Age.)</i></p>
<p>Of all the young bachelors in his tribe not one was more highly
esteemed than Ug, the son of Zug. He was one of the nicest young
prehistoric men that ever sprang seven feet into the air to avoid
the impulsive bite of a sabre-tooth tiger, or cheered the hearts of
grave elders searching for inter-tribal talent by his lightning
sprints in front of excitable mammoths. Everybody liked Ug, and it
was a matter of surprise to his friends that he had never
married.</p>
<p>One bright day, however, they were interested to observe that he
had begun to exhibit all the symptoms. He brooded apart. Twice in
succession he refused a second help of pterodactyl at the tribal
luncheon table. And there were those who claimed to have come upon
him laboriously writing poetry on the walls of distant caves.</p>
<p>It should be understood that in those days only the most
powerful motive, such as a whole-hearted love, could drive a man to
writing poetry; for it was not the ridiculously simple task which
it is to-day. The alphabet had not yet been invented, and the only
method by which a young man could express himself was by carving or
writing on stone a series of pictures, each of which conveyed the
sense of some word or phrase. Thus, where the modern bard takes but
a few seconds to write, "You made me love you. I didn't want to do
it, I didn't want to do it," Ug, the son of Zug, had to sit up
night after night till he had carved three trees, a plesiosaurus,
four kinds of fish, a star-shaped rock, eleven <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> different
varieties of flowering shrub, and a more or less lifelike
representation of a mammoth surprised while bathing. It is little
wonder that the youth of the period, ever impetuous, looked askance
at this method of revealing their passion, and preferred to give
proof of their sincerity and fervour by waiting for the lady of
their affections behind a rock and stunning her with a club.</p>
<p>But the refined and sensitive nature of Ug, the son of Zug,
shrank from this brusque form of wooing. He was shy with women. To
him there was something a little coarse, almost ungentlemanly, in
the orthodox form of proposal; and he had made up his mind that, if
ever he should happen to fall in love, he would propose by
ideograph.</p>
<p>It was shortly after he had come to this decision that, at a
boy-and-girl dance given by a popular local hostess, he met the
divinest creature he had ever seen. Her name was Wug, the daughter
of Glug; and from the moment of their introduction he realised that
she was the one girl in the world for him. It only remained to
compose the ideograph.</p>
<p>Having steadied himself as far as possible by carving a few
poems, as described above, he addressed himself to the really
important task of the proposal.</p>
<p>It was extraordinarily difficult, for Ug had not had a very good
education. All he knew he had picked up in the give and take of
tribal life. For this reason he felt it would be better to keep the
thing short. But it was hard to condense all he felt into a brief
note. For a long time he thought in vain, then one night, as he
tossed sleeplessly on his bed of rocks, he came to a decision. He
would just ideograph, "Dear Wug, I love you. Yours faithfully, Ug.
P.S. R.S.V.P.," and leave it at that. So in the morning he got to
work, and by the end of the week the ideograph was completed. It
consisted of a rising sun, two cave-bears, a walrus, seventeen
shin-bones of the lesser rib-nosed baboon, a brontosaurus, three
sand-eels, and a pterodactyl devouring a mangold-wurzel. It was an
uncommonly neat piece of work, he considered, for one who had never
attended an art-school. He was pleased with it. It would, he
flattered himself, be a queer sort of girl who could stand out
against that. For the first time for weeks he slept soundly and
peacefully.</p>
<p>Next day his valet brought him with his morning beverage a piece
of flat rock. On it was carved a simple human thigh-bone. He
uttered a loud cry. She had rejected him. The parcel-post, an hour
later, brought him his own ideograph, returned without a word.</p>
<p>Ug's greatest friend in the tribe was Jug, son of Mug, a youth
of extraordinary tact and intelligence. To him Ug took his
trouble.</p>
<p>Jug heard his story, and asked to see exactly what he had
ideographed.</p>
<p>"You must have expressed yourself badly," he said.</p>
<p>"On the contrary," replied Ug, with some pique, "my proposal was
brief, but it was a model of what that sort of proposal should be.
Here it is. Read it for yourself."</p>
<p>Jug read it. Then he looked at his friend, concerned.</p>
<p>"But, my dear old man, what on earth did you mean by saying she
has red hair and that you hate the sight of her?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Why, this ichthyosaurus."</p>
<p>"That's not an ichthyosaurus. It's a brontosaurus."</p>
<p>"It's not a bit like a brontosaurns. And it <i>is</i> rather
like an ichthyosaurus. Where you went wrong was in not taking a few
simple lessons in this sort of thing first."</p>
<p>"If you ask me," said Ug disgustedly, "this picture-writing is
silly rot. To-morrow I start an Alphabet."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>But on the morrow he was otherwise employed. He was standing,
concealed behind a rock, at the mouth of the cave of Wug, daughter
of Glug. There was a dreamy look in his eyes, and his fingers were
clasped like steel bands round the handle of one of the most
business-like clubs the Stone Age had ever seen. Orthodoxy had
found another disciple.</p>

<h2>THE SUBSCRIPTION.</h2>
<p>Charles, when our protest was lodged, merely replied that our
favour of the 10th inst. was to hand, and that he really could not
see his way to moving further in the matter. Let me explain the
present extent of Charles's movement.</p>
<p>Miss Donelan, who ought to have known better, had allowed
herself to be saddled with a thing called a Branch subscription
list on behalf of the St. Nicholas New Year Offering.</p>
<p>Having exploited the probables and possibles she finally handed
the document on to me with instructions to tout it round among my
friends. (This is the sort of thing you get nowadays for placing
your life at a young woman's disposal.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have no friends just now, except what I want to
keep. While I was thus at a loss, Charles came to stay for a few
days three doors off. He lives a long way away and would have time
to forget before I saw him again. So on the day before his
departure I bearded him like a man.</p>
<p>"Charles," I began, "you are fabulously rich. Your income comes
in at such a pace that you hardly ever know within five shillings
how much you have at the bank."</p>
<p>Charles blinked through the smoke of a violet-tipped
cigarette.</p>
<p>"What about it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"This," I said; "I am, very reluctantly, offering you the chance
of doing good. All you have to do is to sign your name here for
anything up to a hundred pounds, and the good does itself. It is
the Saint Nicholas New Year Offering."</p>
<p>"What does it do?" asked Charles uncomfortably.</p>
<p>"Do?" I answered. "Why, I don't think it does exactly <i>do</i>.
You see it's a New Year Offering."</p>
<p>"I see," said Charles. "It doesn't do; it offers. Just like a
Member of Parliament."</p>
<p>"I wish," I said, "instead of being funny at other people's
expense you would be serious at your own, and tell me exactly how
much I can put you down for?"</p>
<p>"There you go again," said Charles. "You want me to think of
some definite amount on the spot. You know I hate thinking, and I
hate definite amounts. And I loathe doing anything on the
spot."</p>
<p>I looked at the subscription list. The last entry
was:&mdash;</p>
<pre>
    Major-General R. Hewland, &pound;5 5<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>.
</pre>
<p>"You needn't do any thinking," I explained patiently. "You need
only stick down exactly the same as the last man. And if you'll
promise to do it I'll leave the list with you, and you can fill it
in when you feel sufficiently off the spot."</p>
<p>"Exactly the same?" asked Charles.</p>
<p>"Exactly," I said, with rising hopes.</p>
<p>"All right," said Charles. "I'll let you have it some time."</p>
<p>Four days later, at Miss Donelan's urgent request, I wrote to
Charles for it. It came in less than forty-eight hours.</p>

which have reached him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I gave up your journal many years ago on account of
its partisanship, and never read it now. Only last week I came
across a paragraph in my copy which made me throw the paper into

<p>Sir,&mdash;I object to the advertisements. I think it would be a
good move if you were to drop these, increase the number of pages,
and reduce the price to a halfpenny. In taking this course you
would have the support of several influential members of my parish,
in addition to myself.</p>
<p class="yours">Yours faithfully,    A COUNTRY PARSON.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;What your paper needs is light relief. Could you not
give us a little humour now and then?</p>
<p class="yours">Yours faithfully,      A POPULAR WRITER.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;The last MS. you returned to me was very much
crumpled. Please be more careful in the future.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I think it a pity you publish jokes. In this age,
when all things&mdash;even our dear Bishops&mdash;are considered
fit subjects for jest, we could do with one serious-minded paper.
Trusting you will think this over,</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;-You should see our American comic papers.</p>
<p class="yours">Yours faithfully,      WASHINGTON G. BUSTER.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I find the blank pages at the back of the cartoons
very useful for making notes on. Could you not extend this
feature?</p>
<p class="yours">Yours faithfully,      PROFESSOR.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I think you would do well to cater more for
women&mdash;who, after all, are a rising sex. A page each week
devoted to modern fashions would not be at all out of place in your
paper.</p>
<p class="yours">Yours faithfully,      EVE.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;In my opinion your paper is the cleverest in the

your consideration, and am,</p>

<h2>THE PAPER-CHASE.</h2>
<p>I arrived at home at three o'clock on a frosty afternoon. "Now,"
thought I, "I shall have a quiet time before tea and shall be able
to write a few letters and start my article." It was a dream of
usefully employed leisure, but it didn't last long.</p>
<p>I found the whole family, with the addition of a little
boyfriend, gathered together in a very purposeful and alarming way
in the library There was about them an undefinable air of the
chase, for they were all well-booted and belted, and Peggy had a
large clasp-knife dangling at her waist. "It is for the hare," she
said, "when we catch him."</p>
<p>"The hare?" I said. "What hare?"</p>
<p>"You," said the lady of the house cheerfully, "are to be the
hare. You are to run till you are cooked, and then you will be
caught."</p>
<p>"What madness is this?" I said.</p>
<p>"It's not madness a bit," said Helen indignantly. "It's a
paper-chase."</p>
<p>"And I," said Rosie, "have torn up all <i>The Timeses</i>."</p>
<p>"And I," said John, who is not always sure of his tenses, though
he is very voluble, "have tored up <i>The Daily Newses</i>."</p>
<p>"That's capital," I said with enthusiasm. "A paper-chase is the
best fun in the world. I'll see you start and give you a
cheer."</p>
<p>"You can't do that," said Helen firmly, "because we've settled
that you're to carry the bag and be the hare."</p>
<p>"Come, come," I said, "this is an unworthy proposal. Would you
chase your more than middle-aged father over the open country?
Never. How could he look the village in the face if he were to be
seen scattering little bits of paper from a linen bag? He would
fall in their estimation and would drag you all with him in his
fall. John," I said, "you would not have your father fall, would
you?"</p>
<p>"It would make me laugh," said John, and the rest seemed to
think that this callous remark settled the matter.</p>
<p>"Anyhow," I said, "I must have plenty of law."</p>
<p>"We won't have any law," said Helen, who is an intelligent
child; "it's all quarrellings."</p>
<p>"Law," I said, "is the embodiment of human wisdom. In this case
it means that I'm going to have ten minutes' start. Everyone of you
must pledge his or her honour not to move until I've been gone ten
minutes."</p>
<p>They made no difficulty about this, and, the lady of the house
having appointed herself time-keeper and having promised to have a
large tea ready for us when we returned, I was sent on my way with
a bag of paper and many shrill shouts of encouragement.</p>
<p>Now I ask my colleagues in the parental business to consider my
case. I daresay they fancy themselves as runners on the strength of
their remembered boyish feats and of certain more recent runs when
they have lingered too long over breakfast and have had to catch a
train. I warn them not to build a paper-chase on so slender a
foundation. A jog-trot seems the easiest thing in the world, but
after two hundred yards the temptation to lapse into a walk becomes
irresistible. I will dwell no further on my own experiences, but
transfer myself in imagination to the hounds who were chasing me.
Afterwards I heard so much of their exploits that I almost came to
feel I had shared in their daring and been a party to their final
success.</p>
<p>From the garden door the line led across the road and on to a
track skirting the railway. This piece was taken at a brisk pace,
the scent being breast-high. A sheet might have covered the whole
pack. Then came a hairpin turn over the level crossing, a swing to
the right and a steady trudge up the hill. Half-way up there were
gates to the right and the left, and here the blown but wary hare
had laid his first false trail. This unsuspected device roused the
utmost indignation, and doubts were freely expressed as to its
being legitimate. John was sent to the right to investigate; Peggy
went off to the left, which proved to be the true trail, and in a
very short time the dauntless five were once more in full cry.
Rosie, who is a reader of books, afterwards said that no
sleuth-hounds could have done the thing better. So by paths and
ploughed fields and over gates and stiles the dreadful chase
continued until there came another check. "These," said Helen,
pointing to some pieces of paper, "are not newspaper. They are bits
of letters." It was too true. <i>The Timeses</i> and <i>The Daily
Newses</i> had given out, and the hare, omitting nothing that might
lead to his destruction, had torn up all his available
correspondence. It threw the pack out for a few minutes, but they
rallied. In another hundred-and-fifty yards they ran into their
hare, who, paperless and letterless, had taken refuge behind a tree
and was ignominiously hauled out.</p>
<p>So ended our great Christmas paper-chase, an event which must
remain justly celebrated both for the ardour with which it was
undertaken and for the endurance with which it was pursued. What a
chatter there was as we returned, what a narration of glorious
incidents of pace, of skill and of cunning defeated by greater
cunning. Falls there had been and shin-scrapes and the tearing of
skirts and stockings, and legends were made up and told again and
again. And at home the lady of the house had to hear it all once
more, and the tea she gave us was voted the best in the world.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CONTINENTAL INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>An extraordinary domestic tragedy is reported from a remote
province of Poland. A beautiful young woman, named Vera Alexandrina
Polianowski, who had been married only about two years, was
expecting the return home of her husband, a sailor. During his
absence of five months a mournful calamity had befallen her in an
affection of the larynx, which threatened to deprive her
temporarily of the power to articulate. Realising her impending
affliction, she had taught a grey parrot, which her husband had
left with her, to exclaim repeatedly from just inside the door of
her cottage, in joyous accents that bore no inconsiderable
resemblance to her own once melodious voice, these touching words,
"Enter, dearest Vladimir, and console me for my misfortune!"</p>
<p>It chanced, however, that before marrying Vladimir Polianowski,
the sailor, Vera Alexandrina had had a lover in poor circumstances
named Vladimir Crackovitch, whom, with the thoughtlessness of a
beautiful young girl, she had encouraged to get rich as quickly as
he could in America and then return to claim her as his bride.
Vladimir Crackovitch had taken her at her word. With the silent
determination of a great soul, he had amassed about a hundred
thousand dollars in America in less than four years, and only two
or three minutes before Vera Alexandrina's husband was due to
arrive he himself stood at the cottage door with folded arms,
asking himself if he should or should not enter and reproach Vera
Alexandrina for her inconstancy.</p>
<p>His hesitation was suddenly overcome by the parrot. "Enter,
dearest Vladimir, and console me for my misfortune!" it cried
eagerly from within, and, not for an instant doubting that it was
an invitation from the woman whom he still loved fondly in spite of
her perfidy, and being unaware of her laryngeal affliction, he
bounded into the house and hurried from room to room until he found
Vera Alexandrina Polianowski.</p>
<p>But Vladimir, the sailor, had already in the meantime, from the
top of an adjacent lane, beheld Vladimir Crackovitch at the door of
his home, and, being a man of the most blindly passionate and
jealous impulses, his next procedure may be imagined.</p>
<p>Several hours later a neighbour called at the cottage and
discovered the three corpses in one sad heap: Vera Alexandrina
Polianowski, shot through the breast; at her side, Vladimir
Crackovitch, with a bullet in each eye; and, still clutching his
revolver, Vladimir, the sailor, seated upon his grim cushion of the
dead, his back supported against the wall under the domestic
lamplit icon, with a smile of hellish satisfaction frozen upon his
lips and the remaining three bullets buried in his heart.</p>
<p>The above is not necessarily a true story. It is a specimen of
the small-print news with which the rather young Assistant
Sub-Editor of <i>The Dullandshire Chronicle</i> (established 1763)
is permitted, occasionally, to divert those of <i>The
Chronicle's</i> subscribers who take an intelligent interest in
continental affairs.</p>

<h2>THE HUNTSMAN'S STORY.</h2>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I heard the huntsman calling as he drew Threeacre Spinney;</p>
<p class="i2">He found a fox and hunted him and handled him ere
night,</p>
<p>And his voice upon the hill-side was as golden as a guinea,</p>
<p class="i2">And I ventured he'd done nicely&mdash;most respectful
and polite&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Jig-jogging back to kennels, and the stars were
shining bright.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Old Jezebel and Jealous they were trotting at his stirrup;</p>
<p class="i2">The road was clear, the moon was up, 'twas but a mile
or so;</p>
<p>He got the pack behind him with a chirp and with a chirrup,</p>
<p class="i2">And said he, "I had the secret from my gran'dad long
ago,</p>
<p class="i2">And all the old man left me, Sir, if you should want
to know.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And he was most a gipsy, Sir, and spoke the gipsy lingos,</p>
<p class="i2">But he knew of hounds and horses all as NIMROD might
have know'd:</p>
<p>When we'd ask him how he did it, he would say, 'You little
Gringos,</p>
<p class="i2">I learnt it from a lady that I met upon the road;</p>
<p class="i2">In the hills o' Connemara was this wondrous gift
bestowed.'</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Connemara&mdash;County Galway&mdash;he was there in 1830;</p>
<p class="i2">He was taking hounds to kennel, all alone, he used to
say,</p>
<p>And the hills of Connemara, when the night is falling dirty,</p>
<p class="i2">Is an ill place to be left in when the dusk is
turning grey,</p>
<p class="i2">An ill place to be lost in most at any time o'
day.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Adown the dismal mountains that night it blew tremendous,</p>
<p class="i2">A-sobbing like a giant and a-snorting like a
whale,</p>
<p>When he saw beside the sheep-track ('Holy Saints,' says he,
'defend us!')</p>
<p class="i2">A mighty dainty lady, dressed in green, and sweet and
pale,</p>
<p class="i2">And she rode an all-cream pony with an Arab head and
tail.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Says she to him, 'Young gentleman, to you I'd be beholden</p>
<p class="i2">If you'd ride along to Fairyland this night beside o'
me;</p>
<p>There's a fox that eats our chickens&mdash;them that lays the
eggs that's golden&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">And our little fairy mouse-dogs, ah, 'tis small
account they'll be,</p>
<p class="i2">Sure it wants an advertising pack to gobble such as
he!'</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"So gran'dad says, 'Your servant, Miss,' and got his hounds
together,</p>
<p class="i2">And the mountain-side flew open and they rode into
the hill;</p>
<p>'Your country's one to cross,' says he, and rights a
stirrup-leather,</p>
<p class="i2">And he found in half-a-jiffey, and he finished with a
kill;</p>
<p class="i2">And the little fairy lady, she was with 'em with a
will.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Then 'O,' says she, 'young man,' says she, ''tis lonesome here
in Faerie,</p>
<p class="i2">So won't you stay and hunt with us and never more to
roam,</p>
<p>And take a bride'&mdash;she looks at him&mdash;'whose youth can
never vary,</p>
<p class="i2">With hair as black as midnight and a breast as white
as foam?'</p>
<p class="i2">And 'Thank you, Miss,' says gran'dad, 'but I've got a
wife at home!'</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Then, 'O, young man,' says she, 'young man, then you shall take
a bounty,</p>
<p class="i2">A bounty of my magic that may grant you wishes
three;</p>
<p>Come make yourself the grandest man from out o' Galway
County</p>
<p class="i2">To Dublin's famous city all of my good gramarye?'</p>
<p class="i2">And, 'Thank you, Miss,' says gran'dad, 'but such
ain't no use to me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But he said, since she was pressing of her fairy spells and
forces,</p>
<p class="i2">He'd take the threefold bounty, lest a gift he'd seem
to scorn:</p>
<p>He'd ask, beyond all other men, the tricks o' hounds and
horses,</p>
<p class="i2">And a voice to charm a woodland of a soft December
morn,</p>
<p class="i2">And sons to follow after him, all to the business
born.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And&mdash;but here we are at home, Sir. Yes, the old man was a
terror</p>
<p class="i2">For his fairies and his nonsense, yet the story's
someways right;</p>
<p>He'd the trick o' hounds and horses to a marvel&mdash;and no
error;</p>
<p class="i2">And to hear him draw a woodland was a pride and a
delight;</p>
<p class="i2">And&mdash;<i>was it luck entirely, Sir, I killed my
fox to-night?</i>"</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE WONDER.</h2>
<p>The crowd had gone, the lights had been extinguished, and the
doors of the music-hall were shut. The Little Wonder was tired
after the performance; his attempt to do the double somersault had
strained him, and his failure had brought a whipping. Although the
outhouse in which he was to lie was cold and damp and smelt
horribly, he was glad when his master thrust him into it, and he
was content to lie down in the straw and forget his misery in
sleep.</p>
<p>He dreamt a beautiful dream. He dreamt that he was a master, and
that he was presenting to a crowded audience what he had billed as
"A Marvel of the Twentieth Century"&mdash;a performing man. The man
was a creature with a pink face, oily hair, and a black moustache;
and the Little Wonder, in his capacity as master, made the Marvel
bark like a dog, whereat the audience yelped its approval. Then the
collar of a member of the audience was handed on to the stage,
while the Marvel was blindfolded, and, after sniffing the collar,
he succeeded in tracking down its owner&mdash;like a dog again. And
in whatever trick the Marvel did, the Little Wonder was close
behind him, looking so friendly and threatening him with low growls
at the same time. If the Marvel happened to remember for a moment
his miserable condition and to look unhappy, his master would look
still more kindly and threaten even more sternly. Then came the
moment when the orchestra stopped suddenly, and the kettledrum
rolled, and the eyes of the audience were fixed upon the Marvel.
For this remarkable performing man was scratching in a tub of earth
to find a bone&mdash;just like a real dog; and that was his
greatest trick. When he had successfully performed it, his master
(the Little Wonder) presented him with a twopenny cigar clothed in
a flashy cummerbund, to show how generously he rewarded
achievements. Then, as the curtain fell, he retired with many
bows&mdash;and in the wings gave the Marvel a hot time for shirking
the biscuit trick.</p>
<p>I question whether the Little Wonder in real life would have so
ill-treated any creature; but things are different in dreams; and,
as he slept, a smile seemed to come into the shaggy face of this
little Irish terrier.</p>

<h3>RECORD RISKS.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>(A Sequel to "Narrow Escapes.")</i></p>
<p>The report that M. PADEREWSKI has been hunted by Nihilists out
of Denver has suggested to the Editor of <i>The Musical Mirror</i>
the happy thought of circularising a number of prominent musicians
with a view to ascertaining the most dangerous experiences they
have ever undergone.</p>
<p>Sir FREDERICK BRIDGE writes to say that the worst quarter of a
minute he ever spent was while tarpon fishing off the coast of
Florida, when a gigantic tarpon, weighing some 400 lbs., leaped
into the boat with its mouth wide open. With great presence of mind
the famous organist thrust into the monster's gaping jaws a full
score of STRAUSS'S <i>Elektra</i>, which he was studying between
the casts, and the tarpon at once leaped out of the boat and was
never seen or heard of again.</p>
<p>Madame MELBA'S most perilous experience was on a tour in the Far
East, when the liner in which she was travelling was caught by a
tidal wave and hurled with enormous velocity towards the rocky
coast of Sumatra. Noticing that a large whale was following the
vessel, and remembering the peculiar susceptibility of these giant
mammals to musical sounds, Madame MELBA sang the <i>scena</i>,
"Ocean, thou mighty monster," with such persuasive force that the
whale allowed itself to be made fast with a hawser and then towed
the liner back safely into the open sea.</p>
<p>Mr. Bamborough (formerly M. Bamberger) recounted the episode,
already alluded to in these columns, when he was partially eaten by
cannibals in the Solomon Islands; but the details are too harrowing
for reproduction, even in a condensed form. It is interesting to
learn, however, that a punitive expedition was despatched by the
British Government to avenge the insult, as a result of which Mr.
Bamborough was awarded an indemnity of 1,000 bales of copra, 20
tons of sandalwood, and &pound;3,000 worth of tortoiseshell.</p>
<p>Sir FREDERICK COWEN, in reply to the circular, states that the
closest call he ever had was when adjudicating at a Welsh
Eisteddfod. In consequence of an unpopular award he was besieged in
his hotel by an infuriated crowd and only escaped by changing
clothes with a policeman.</p>
<p>Professor Quantock de Banville relates how, while obtaining
local colour for his new Choral Symphony, he was attacked by a
gorilla in Central Africa, but tamed the mighty simian by the power
of his eye.</p>
<p>In conclusion we may note that the only disappointing answer was
received from Signor Crinuto, the famous pianist, who replied, "I
have never had a close shave, and never intend to have one."</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>
<p class="center">"THE POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL."</p>
<p>EMERSON says somewhere that there are great ways of borrowing;
that, if you can contrive to transmute base metal into fine, nobody
will worry as to where you got your base metal from. But, when it
is the other way about, I think you must not be surprised if people
ask you where you lifted your gold. And the answer, in the case of
Miss ELEANOR GATES, is that the nuggets were the property of LEWIS
CARROLL. She has taken the sprightly and fantastic humour of
<i>Alice in Wonderland,</i> passed it through the alembic (if that
is the word) of her American imagination, and the result is
something that hardly lets you smile at all. It is not a typical
product of native industry, but even that does not make it much
easier for us to grasp the secret of its success over there. It
would seem that nearly all Transatlantic humour, indigenous or
adoptive, is apt, like certain wines, to suffer in the process of
sea-transit.</p>

<p>WITH THE "TELL-TALE FOREST" HUNT.</p>
<p><i>The Hobby Rider</i> (Mr. CHERRY) takes the temperature of
<i>The Poor Little Rich Girl</i> (Miss STEPHANIE BELL).</p>
<p>The hound is Mr. ERNEST HENDRIE <i>(The Man who makes
Faces)</i>, well-known as <i>The Dog</i> in <i>The Blue
Bird</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>Her "Poor Little Rich Girl" is poor because her parents are too
rich. Her father is too busy with finance and her mother with
social climbing to spare time for their daughter's company, so they
leave her to the care of governesses and menials. Her nurse,
anxious for an evening out at a picture-palace, gives the child an
overdose of sleeping-mixture, with the result that she nearly dies
of it. In the course of delirious dreams she finds herself in the
"Tell-Tale Forest" (which threatens to recall <i>The Palace of
Truth</i>), and here all the picturesque phrases which she has been
in the childish habit of misinterpreting in their literal
sense&mdash;"a bee in the bonnet," to "ride hobbies," "to play
ducks and drakes," "to pay the piper," and so forth&mdash;are
realised in human or animal form. With these are mixed the familiar
figures of her waking life, all of them exposed in their true
characters so that you can distinguish the devotion of the doctor
(who now appears in pink because he likes riding hobbies) and the
affection of the teddy-bear (now expanded to human proportions)
from the serpentine nature of the governess and the double-faced
dealings of the nurse. Her father, who is a stranger to her, comes
on dressed in banknotes and chained to a safe; her mother, also a
stranger, wears a society bee which buzzes in the place where her
bonnet would have been; and five samples of the fashionable world,
where, as you know, everybody thinks the same thing at the same
time, let off recitatives from time to time in unison. And there
was much talk about "Robin Hood's Barn," a thing I was never told
about at an age when I am sure it would have given me sincere
pleasure.</p>
<p>Here and there the symbolism was obvious to the point of
crudity; but you searched in vain for a consistent scheme. The
father in his banknotes lashed to a ponderous safe was an easy
personification of the slavery of wealth, and the pantomime ducks
and drakes were simple to understand as symbolizing the career of a
spendthrift (though the father was never that); but why, you asked,
did the double-faced nurse exhaust all her spare moments and our
patience pirouetting about the stage? Did she represent the levity
of the dual life? Not at all; her actions bore no moral
significance: she was just giving a literal illustration of a
phrase&mdash;"to dance attendance."</p>
<p>I don't know how the children in the audience appreciated all
this, but I confess that some of it left me wondering whether my
intelligence was too raw or too ripe for the fancies of this
Wonder-Zoo-Land.</p>
<p>The First Act, which showed the child's life at home, had fallen
altogether flat; but the Third, in which she wakes in her pretty
bedroom, restored from the jaws of death to her repentant parents,
put us on better terms with ourselves, for we were not really hard
to please. The sweetness of it was perhaps a little cloying, but it
was all quite nice and sympathetic. Still, I am afraid I agreed
more than I was meant to with the speech of pretty little Miss
STEPHANIE BELL, when she told us before the curtain that they would
cable to the author in America to say how glad we were that it was
all over.</p>
<p>Mr. ERNEST HENDRIE, who was translated from an organ-grinder to
a maker of faces, played very soundly, but seemed to me a little
too deliberate and conscious in his speech. I found a more moving
appeal in the slight pathetic sketch of an old faithful butler by
Mr. GEORGE MALLETT. Mr. FEWLASS LLEWELLYN might easily, with a
little assistance from the author, have extracted a lot more fun
from his Plumber. Mr. MALCOLM CHERRY had a simple and popular part
as the good Doctor. Miss HELEN HAYE'S cleverness was wasted on the
character of a sinuous governess. Miss EVELYN WEEDEN did all that
was asked of the mother in both worlds&mdash;the world of fancy and
the world of fact. But, to speak truth, there was little attraction
in the performance apart from the personality of Miss STEPHANIE
BELL in the title <i>r&ocirc;le</i>. If the play is to
succeed&mdash;and its hope lies in the good temper and high spirits
of holiday time&mdash;the author will owe most to the natural charm
of this delightful young lady, who played throughout with a most
engaging sincerity and ease.</p>

Clerks.)</i></p>
<p>If for nothing else, Mr. JACK LONDON'S latest story would
deserve a welcome for its topicality. In these days of strikes and
industrial conflict every one might be glad to know what a writer
of his individuality has to say about unions and blacklegs and
picketing. True, this is hardly the kind of thing that one has
learnt to associate with his name; and for that reason perhaps I
best liked <i>The Valley of the Moon</i> (MILLS AND BOON) after its
hero and heroine had shaken the unsavoury dust of the town from
their feet and set them towards the open country. But much had to
happen first. The hero was big <i>Billy Roberts</i>, a teamster
with the heart of a child and the strength of a
prize-fighter&mdash;which was in fact his alternative profession.
He married <i>Saxon Brown</i> ("a scream of a name" her friend
called it when introducing them to each other), and for a time
their life together was as nearly idyllic as newly-wedded
housekeeping in a mean street could permit it to be. Then came the
lean years: strikes and strike-breaking, sabotage and rioting,
prison for <i>Billy</i>, and all but starvation for <i>Saxon</i>.
Perhaps you know already that peculiar gift of Mr. JACK LONDON'S
that makes you not only see physical hardship but suffer it? I
believe that after these chapters the reader of them will never
again be able to regard a newspaper report of street-fighting with
the same detachment as before, so vivid are they, so haunting. In
the end, however, as I say, we find a happier atmosphere. The
adventures of <i>Billy</i> and <i>Saxon</i>, tramping it in search
of a home, soon make their urban terrors seem to them and the
reader a kind of nightmare. Here Mr. LONDON is at his delightful
best, and his word-pictures of country scenes are as fresh and fine
as anything he has yet done. <i>The Valley of the Moon</i>, in
short, is really two stories&mdash;one grim, one pleasant, and both
brilliantly successful.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is perhaps a mistake to read a novel at a sitting, since the
reaction is too sudden and the reader is apt to find the real life
and the real people surrounding him highly unsatisfactory by
contrast. Mr. JAMES PROSPER has reduced me to this state by <i>The
Mountain Apart</i> (HEINEMANN), but it is my duty as critic to
disregard my personal feelings and judge impartially between the
fictitious and the actual. Duty, then, compels me to say that the
<i>Mr. Henry Harding</i> who at the last solved all the
difficulties of <i>Rose Hilton</i> by the simple expedient of a
romantic proposal is a hollow fraud. The position was this:
<i>Rose</i> was a woman of flesh and blood and all the human
limitations, blessed and cursed with all the intricacies allotted
by Providence to the sex. Her trouble was that she had to face life
as it is, and this she found very trying. She suffered from her
marriage to a man old enough to be her grandfather, and from her
abortive grapplings both with the abstract problems of her soul and
the concrete mischiefs of her female friends. The influence of
IBSEN and a militant Suffragette didn't help her meditations, and
when her husband died she had the mortification to find that the
first man of her own age who professed love to her was no man but a
series of artistic poses. Of her difficulties, real enough up to
this point, the solution was the fraudulent <i>Henry</i>,
fraudulent because he was just a stage hero whose actions and
conversation resembled nothing on earth. <i>Henry</i>, in fact, is
the sort of person that doesn't exist, and, if he did, would be
intolerable to everybody except a novel reader worked up to a
climax. I doubt if even such a reader could stand the fellow on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg
20]</span> longer acquaintance. To this conclusion all must come in
their saner moments, and yet most will, I think, finish the book in
one spell and be under the delusion at the end of it that all their
troubles would be solved at once if only their friends would talk
and conduct themselves more like <i>Henry</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In <i>Theodore Roosevelt: an Autobiography</i> (MACMILLAN) the
ex-President shows us how it was done: how he started life as a
weakly lad and by perseverance made himself what he is to-day. But
what is he? That is the insoluble problem. No two people, least of
all Americans, seem to agree on the point. I have heard Mr.
ROOSEVELT called everything from a charlatan to the Saviour of his
Country. For myself, if I may intrude my own view, I have always
admired the "Bull Moose." But, since nobody on this earth, in
America or out of it, can really understand American politics, my
respect has been for Mr. ROOSEVELT'S private rather than his public
performances. And in the view that he is, take him all round, a
pretty good sort of man, this book has confirmed me. He has told
his story well. Nor is the Power of the Human "I" too much in
evidence. It is just a simple, straightforward tale of a
particularly interesting life. Whatever your views on Mr. ROOSEVELT
may be, the fact remains that he has been a cowboy, a police
commissioner of New York, a soldier on active service, and the
President of God's Country, suh; and a man must have an unusually
negative personality if he cannot make entertainment for us out of
that. Now nobody has ever suspected Mr. ROOSEVELT of a negative
personality; and it is certain that he has told a very entertaining
story. There are in this volume battle, murder, sudden death,
outlaws, cowboys, bears, American politics, and the author's views
on the English blackbird, all handsomely illustrated, and the price
is only what you would (or would not) pay for a stall to see a
musical comedy. It's a bargain.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Between the rising of the partisans of the Duchesse DE BERRI and
the dawn of the Tractarian movement there would not seem, at first
blush, to be any very close association apart from the coincidence
of their dates; yet in <i>The Vision Splendid</i> (MURRAY), by D.K.
BROSTER and G.W. TAYLOR, a link is furnished in the person of an
English clergyman's daughter, who marries a Frenchman of the
"Legitimist" aristocracy, and is loved, before and afterwards, by
an enthusiastic disciple of the Oriel Common Room. But the link is
too slight to give a proper unity to the tale; and we have to fall
back upon contrasts. Even so, the two modes of life which made up,
between them, the experience of the <i>Comtesse de la Roche-Guyon
(n&eacute;e Horatia Grenville</i>) are too cleanly severed by the
estranging Channel to be brought into sharp antithesis, except in
the heart of the one woman. And, since it is difficult to
understand why anyone so British in her independence and aloofness
should have surrendered her heart to the first good-looking
Frenchman who came her way, we never get to be on very intimate
terms with that organ. The construction of the story tends to break
up the action and make its interest desultory. While we are
spending a hundred odd pages at one time and fifty odd at another
in Paris and Brittany we forget, very contentedly, about Oriel; and
while we are in residence at Oxford we are practically cut
off&mdash;no doubt, to our spiritual gain&mdash;from the things of
France. The authors seem to belong to the solid old-fashioned
school that had the patience to spread itself and leave as little
as might be to the imagination. I suspect one of them of supplying
the foreign information and the other of being the correspondent on
home and clerical affairs. I don't know how many of them&mdash;if
any&mdash;are women, but I seem to trace a female hand in some of
the domestic details. But the book contains strong matter,
too&mdash;both of narrative and characterization; as in the dying
of <i>Armand de la Roche-Guyon</i>, and the picture of his lover,
<i>Madame de Vigerie</i>. And there is something of the inspiration
of the Holy Grail in that "Vision Splendid" which heartens
<i>Tristram Hungerford</i> to make sacrifice of his passion that he
may give his soul unshared to the service of the Church.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Until I had read Mr. A. RADCLYFFE DUGMORE'S book and revelled in
his most wonderful photographs I had never wished to be a caribou;
but now that I have fully digested <i>The Romance of the
Newfoundland Caribou</i> (HEINEMANN) there is only one animal whose
lot in life I really envy. This is due not to a natural sympathy
with caribous (for, as the author says, "In England it is quite the
exception to find anyone who knows what the caribou is, unless he
happens to have been to Newfoundland or certain parts of Canada,"
and I was never one of the exceptions), but to the extraordinary
manner in which Mr. DUGMORE has imparted the affection that be
himself entertains for his chosen beast. Although he shoots with no
more formidable a weapon than a camera, the dangers and risks that
he has run would appal many of the sportsmen whose aim is to
destroy and not to study the lives of animals. He has, however, no
contempt for hunters, provided that they will play the game and
give a fair chance to their quarry. Another point in his favour,
which appeals mightily to me, is that after nine consecutive
seasons in Newfoundland he confesses that his knowledge of the
caribou is still incomplete. This means that, when he does make an
absolute statement, you may be pretty certain that it is true. If I
ever have to argue about the habits of caribous, there is one shot
that will remain in my locker until the very end of the argument,
and it will be, "Well, DUGMORE says so."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
